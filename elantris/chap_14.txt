<div class="article_content">Chapter Nine:
<br/><br/>
	This third ‘chapter triad’ is the first one where I do a real intersection of the three viewpoints.  Raoden sees Hrathen on the wall, Sarene and Hrathen spar, then Hrathen thinks about his run-in with Sarene on his way to the meeting with the noblemen.  
<br/><br/>	I’m not sure if I’d ever want to use the chapter triad system again.  It made all kinds of problems for writing the book.  Almost everything else I’ve written has been strictly chronological—if you jump from one viewpoint, or one chapter, to the next, you’re always progressing forward in time.  By jumping backward in two chapters out of three, I gave myself some challenging pacing and coordination issues.  For instance, the important events in each of the three storylines had to happen on generally the same days. Also, I had to rotate the chapters strictly, and so I couldn’t just skip a character during a given time-frame.   That meant I had to have important events happening in all three viewpoints all the time.
<br/><br/>	However, the benefits of this situation are moments like you see in this triad, where I could flow from one chapter to the next, having the timeframes play off of each other.  You might have noticed from this triad that I had to fudge just a bit.  Not all of the viewpoints happen at exactly the same time.  The rule I set up for myself is that they had to all happen on the same day—preferably as close to overlapping each other as possible.  
<br/><br/>	This chapter is one of the prime ‘show Hrathen’s competence’ chapters.  Most of what goes on here is in the way of character development for Hrathen.  The plot of him swaying some of the noblemen is important, but not specifically so.  However, I’ve always said that the stronger—and more clever—the villain is, the better the story is.  By showing how Hrathen deals with the noblemen, I re-enforce his abilities, and justify him as a threat to the city.
<br/><br/>	There were a few small edits to this chapter.  The biggest one was a change where I slightly-weakened Hrathen’s treasonous talk.  In the original, he told the noblemen that he was the gyorn assigned to Duladel before it collapsed.  Moshe pointed out that this was a little too subversive of him to imply in the middle of a group of men who may or may not end up supporting him, so I made the change.
